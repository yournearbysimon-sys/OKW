# uz_AutoShot

**All-in-one screenshot studio for FiveM. Captures clothing, props, vehicles, world objects, and appearance overlays with transparent backgrounds.**

Iterates every drawable and texture automatically, runs chroma key removal server-side, and serves the results in an in-game browser. No external tools needed.

## Features

- **Clothing components**: 11 ped slots (hair, mask, arms, pants, bags, shoes, accessories, undershirt, body armor, decals, tops) iterated by drawable and texture.
- **Prop slots**: hats, glasses, ears, watches, bracelets. Watch and bracelet slots play a wrist-raise animation during capture.
- **Head overlays**: 12 categories including facial hair, eyebrows, makeup, blemishes, ageing, blush, complexion, lipstick, moles, chest hair.
- **Vehicle capture**: auto-detects every loaded vehicle model and groups by class. Built-in primary / secondary color picker before each batch.
- **Object capture**: configurable list of world props in `Customize.lua`. Edit the table or use a one-off command.
- **Orbit camera**: rotate, roll, zoom, height, FOV. Save framing per category mid-session, copy current values to clipboard in Lua format.
- **Server-side chroma key**: magenta or green background removal in Node with despill and 5x5 alpha feather for smooth edges.
- **Wardrobe browser**: `/wardrobe` opens a thumbnail grid with category sidebar, drawable-id search, and click-to-apply preview on your ped.
- **Re-capture broken thumbnails**: select bad shots in the wardrobe, re-shoot only those without re-running the entire batch.
- **Pause and resume**: long capture sessions can be paused mid-batch (default Space) and resumed without losing progress.
- **Quick capture commands**: `/shotcar <model>` and `/shotprop <model>` skip the UI for one-off captures.
- **Cross-resource integration**: server exports return `cfx-nui` photo URLs that any other resource's NUI can render with `<img src="...">`. No HTTP, no port forwarding, no base64.
- **Configurable head chroma mask**: stack multiple spheres on `SKEL_Head` to wipe the head out for accessory and torso shots without clipping the clothing.

## How it works

Type `/shotmaker`, pick what you want to capture, frame the orbit camera, hit Start. Your ped teleports into a hidden studio room, the script iterates every drawable and texture, snaps each frame, and uploads it to the server through a FiveM latent event. The server runs a chroma key pass to remove the background, resizes the result, and writes it to `shots/`. `/wardrobe` browses the output, lets you re-apply items to your ped, and re-captures broken shots. Photos are served straight out of the resource folder over the `cfx-nui` protocol, so other scripts (vehicleshop, clothing menu, ID card, MDT) can `<img src="...">` them directly.

---

## Requirements

- [screenshot-basic](https://github.com/citizenfx/screenshot-basic) *(included on most servers)*
  or [screencapture](https://github.com/itschip/screencapture) *(recommended replacement)*
- FiveM server artifacts with `yarn` support (built-in since 4892+)

---

## Install

1. Drop the folder into `resources/`. The folder must be named exactly `uz_AutoShot` (case-sensitive on Linux). The resource will refuse to start with any other name.
2. Add to `server.cfg` in this order:

   ```
   ensure screenshot-basic
   ensure uz_AutoShot
   ```

3. Start the server. Node dependencies install on first start through the bundled `yarn` runtime. The UI is pre-built in `resources/build/`, no npm step needed.
4. Open `Customize.lua` if you want to change the command names, ACE gating, or chroma color. The defaults are fine for most setups.

---

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/shotmaker` | Open the capture studio. Pick categories, frame the camera, hit Start. |
| `/wardrobe` | Browse captured thumbnails. Apply items to your ped, re-shoot broken ones. |
| `/shotcar <model>` | Capture a single vehicle by spawn name. Skips the full UI. |
| `/shotprop <model>` | Capture a single world object by model name. |

Both `/shotmaker` and `/wardrobe` use the names from `Customize.Command` and `Customize.MenuCommand`, change them there if you want different command names.

### ACE permissions

Set `Customize.AceRestricted = true` in `Customize.lua` to gate the commands. Then in `server.cfg`:

```cfg
add_ace identifier.license:YOUR_LICENSE command.shotmaker allow
add_ace identifier.license:YOUR_LICENSE command.wardrobe allow
add_ace identifier.license:YOUR_LICENSE command.shotcar allow
add_ace identifier.license:YOUR_LICENSE command.shotprop allow
```

Or grant the whole admin group:

```cfg
add_ace group.admin command allow
add_principal identifier.license:YOUR_LICENSE group.admin
```

When `AceRestricted = true`, the server also rejects any capture event from a player that lacks `command.shotmaker`. This is wired through `server/config_bridge.lua`, which exposes `Customize.AceRestricted` to `server.js` via convars at startup.

---

## Camera controls

The orbit camera is active during the preview step before each capture session and during single-shot captures (`/shotcar`, `/shotprop`).

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Left mouse drag | Rotate around the subject |
| Right mouse drag | Roll the camera |
| Scroll wheel | Zoom in / out |
| W / S (or arrow up/down) | Adjust camera height |
| Q / E | Adjust field of view |
| R | Reset to the category's default angle |
| C | Copy the current camera values to your clipboard in Lua format, ready to paste into `Customize.CameraPresets` |

To save the framing for a category mid-session, click the save button in the preview UI. Saved angles persist for the session: when the batch reaches a category you saved, that framing is reused automatically.

---

## Configuration

All settings live in [`Customize.lua`](Customize.lua). Common knobs:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `Customize.Command` | `'shotmaker'` | Capture command name |
| `Customize.MenuCommand` | `'wardrobe'` | Browser command name |
| `Customize.AceRestricted` | `false` | Require ACE permission for commands and capture events |
| `Customize.ScreenshotFormat` | `'png'` | Output format: `'png'`, `'webp'`, or `'jpg'` |
| `Customize.TransparentBg` | `true` | Chroma key removal (PNG only) |
| `Customize.ScreenshotWidth` | `512` | Output image width |
| `Customize.ScreenshotHeight` | `512` | Output image height |
| `Customize.CaptureAllTextures` | `false` | Capture all texture variants (not just default) |
| `Customize.ChromaKeyColor` | `'magenta'` | Background color: `'green'` or `'magenta'` |
| `Customize.BatchSize` | `10` | Captures per batch before cooldown |
| `Customize.LatentRate` | `8000000` | Bytes/sec throttle for capture uploads |

Camera presets, studio lighting, green screen dimensions, the head chroma mask (`Customize.HeadMask`), clothing/prop/overlay categories, and the object list are also configurable in the same file.

## Lua exports

The URL exports return `cfx-nui` paths that any NUI in any resource can render directly via `<img src="...">`. No HTTP request, no base64, no port forwarding.

```lua
exports['uz_AutoShot']:getPhotoURL('male', 'component', 11, 5, 0)
-- 'https://cfx-nui-uz_AutoShot/shots/male/11/5_0.png'

exports['uz_AutoShot']:getPhotoURL('male', 'prop', 0, 12, 0)
-- 'https://cfx-nui-uz_AutoShot/shots/male/prop_0/12_0.png'

exports['uz_AutoShot']:getPhotoURL('male', 'overlay', 1, 3, 0)
-- 'https://cfx-nui-uz_AutoShot/shots/male/overlay_1/3.png'

exports['uz_AutoShot']:getVehiclePhotoURL('adder')
-- 'https://cfx-nui-uz_AutoShot/shots/vehicles/adder.png'

exports['uz_AutoShot']:getObjectPhotoURL('prop_bench_01a')
-- 'https://cfx-nui-uz_AutoShot/shots/objects/prop_bench_01a.png'

exports['uz_AutoShot']:getShotsBaseURL()
-- 'https://cfx-nui-uz_AutoShot/shots'

exports['uz_AutoShot']:getPhotoFormat()
-- 'png'  (whatever Customize.ScreenshotFormat is set to)
```

`getPhotoURL(gender, itemType, id, drawable, texture)` arguments:

- `gender`: `'male'` or `'female'`
- `itemType`: `'component'`, `'prop'`, or `'overlay'`
- `id`: component id (1-11, see `Customize.Categories`), prop id (0, 1, 2, 6, 7), or overlay index (0-11)
- `drawable`: drawable id
- `texture`: texture id. Ignored for `'overlay'`. For `'component'` and `'prop'` the URL always includes `_<texture>` in the filename, which only matches files on disk if you captured with `Customize.CaptureAllTextures = true`. With the default `false`, only texture 0 is captured and the file is named `<drawable>.<ext>` (no `_0`). Either flip that flag before capturing, or build the URL yourself for the no-texture case using `getShotsBaseURL()`.

All exports return strings synchronously. No async, no callbacks.

---

## Output folder

Photos live in `resources/uz_AutoShot/shots/`. Filename pattern depends on `Customize.CaptureAllTextures`:

- `false` (default): only texture 0 captured, file is `<drawable>.<ext>`
- `true`: every texture variant captured, file is `<drawable>_<texture>.<ext>`

Overlays never use a texture suffix.

```

After a fresh capture, restart the resource before any other script can `<img src>` the new file. See the first row of Troubleshooting.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| **Wardrobe and other UIs don't see brand-new captures.** | Restart the resource (`restart uz_AutoShot` or `refresh; ensure uz_AutoShot`). FiveM indexes the `cfx-nui` `files {}` block at resource start, so new PNGs only become servable after the next start. Existing photos keep working without restart. This is the single most common gotcha, do this first. |
| Thumbnails come out fully black or blank. | `screenshot-basic` must start before `uz_AutoShot` in `server.cfg`. Watch the server console for `[uz_AutoShot] Saved: ...` lines while capturing. |
| Magenta or green halo around the subject. | Switch `Customize.ChromaKeyColor`. Magenta tends to cut cleaner on skin tones, green is friendlier with red/orange clothing. |
| Head clips into hats, hoods, or armor. | Tune `Customize.HeadMask`. Make the existing sphere smaller, or stack a second sphere for the neck. The commented neck entry in `Customize.lua` is a starting point. |
| Resource refuses to start, console shows a name error. | Folder must be named exactly `uz_AutoShot`, case-sensitive. |
| Wardrobe is empty. | Run `/shotmaker` to generate photos first, then restart the resource (see the first row). |
| Captures stall mid-batch. | Lower `ScreenshotWidth`/`ScreenshotHeight` to 256 to ease the per-frame cost, or raise `Customize.LatentRate` if upload throughput is the bottleneck. |
| Single capture failing for a model. | Spawn name typo. Use `/shotcar adder` or `/shotprop prop_bench_01a` with the exact model spawn name. |
